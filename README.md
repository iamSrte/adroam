This repository contains the source code for a demo landing page for AdRoam, a conceptual startup platform for car-based advertising. The project is built using the new **React Router v7 framework mode**, combined with **Tailwind CSS** and a set of custom **shadcn components** to create a modern and responsive user experience.
